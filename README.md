# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The dataset, telco-customer-churn.csv, includes customer demographics, account information, and service details. The project implements data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and performance evaluations.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values,
Encoding categorical variables,
Scaling numerical features,
Detecting and handling outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Distribution visualizations for features and target variable (Churn),
Correlation heatmap for numeric columns,
Feature importance analysis.

Machine Learning Models:
Naive Bayes,
Logistic Regression,
Random Forest,
XGBoost,
SMOTE for addressing data imbalance.

Model Evaluation:
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
Visualization: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and Precision-Recall curves.
Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.

Reports:
SweetViz Report: Comprehensive analysis of training and testing datasets.
Pandas Profiling Report: Exploratory analysis report for the dataset.
